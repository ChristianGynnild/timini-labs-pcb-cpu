Beneath the heat sink, circuits hum,
A tiny brain where wonders come.
It calculates with lightning speed,
To fill the world with every need.

From ones and zeros, magic grows,
A stream of data endlessly flows.
It powers games, it runs the net,
A marvel we must not forget.

Through silicon paths, the currents race,
A dance of logic, time, and space.
It renders worlds, it solves, it thinks,
A silent hero at the brink.

From desktops large to phones so small,
It answers every urgent call.
The CPU, a heart so true,
The core of all we build and do.
